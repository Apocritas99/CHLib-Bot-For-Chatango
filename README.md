# CHLib-Bot-For-Chatango<br>
My take on a simple to use bot for chatango. This is my base source code only. Not the full bot<br>

Update Log:<br>
      Added Youtube Command To Source code. You still need your own API Key for Youtube v3 to use the command<br>
      Fixed a glitch where posts were being ignored. This was due to a bug in the prefix code and the bot trying to use the old prefix<br>
      Added A new system of ranking, users now have levels, money and xp<br>
      Added levels, definitions, new Google Image API<br>
      
To do list:<br>
      Add Leaderboards<br>
      Add a bot personality<br>
      Allow the bot to use xmpp<br>
      Give the bot a way to use notification messages for use with lottery, notes between friends, etc.<br>
      Russian Roulette game mode<br>
      Hangman game mode<br>
      Clean up file system and source code to make it run smoothly.<br>

If you happen to find any bugs with this bot please start an issue request and I will get back to you asap.<br>
